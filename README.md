Project Report: Event Ticketing System

Project Plan
The objective of this project is to design a simple event ticketing system that allows users to register, browse events, make reservations, and process payments. The system includes four main components: user registration, event management, transaction processing, and reservation handling.

We aim to use PHP for server-side processing, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end, and MySQL as the database to store and manage data. This project will focus on ensuring that each component interacts seamlessly through relational database management, providing an efficient system for event reservations and payments.

Technical Details
Front-end Development

The front-end of the system is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The primary purpose is to create an intuitive and user-friendly interface where users can:

Register and log in to their accounts.
Browse a list of available events.
Select and reserve tickets for specific events.
Back-end Development

PHP handles the backend logic, interacting with the MySQL database to process form submissions, store data, and retrieve necessary information. The backend:
Validates user inputs during registration and login.
Processes reservations and links them to user profiles, event details, and transactions.
Ensures secure data handling, especially for passwords, by hashing them before storing.
Database Design

The database consists of four main tables: User_Registration, ticketingEvent, Transactions, and Reservations.

User_Registration: Stores user information, including personal details and contact information.
ticketingEvent: Contains event details such as name, type, location, and contact information.
Transactions: Records transaction information, including the number of tickets sold, payment methods, and the date/time of each transaction.
Reservations: Links users to the events theyâ€™ve reserved by referencing the User_Registration, ticketingEvent, and Transactions tables using foreign keys.
The schema uses relationships and foreign keys to ensure the integrity of data. For example, when a reservation is made, it connects a user to a specific event and ties it to a transaction, ensuring that each reservation is properly tracked.

Joins for Data Retrieval
To retrieve related data across different tables, SQL joins are used. For example, when a user views their reservation details, a join between the Reservations, User_Registration, ticketingEvent, and Transactions tables is used to display relevant information like event name, user details, and payment status. This approach ensures that all necessary data is accessible without redundancy and improves data integrity.

Conclusion
This project creates a simple yet effective system for managing event reservations and payments. The database design ensures that users, events, transactions, and reservations are properly linked using foreign keys and SQL joins. The integration of PHP for backend processing and MySQL for database management results in a smooth, user-friendly event management system. Through this project, we were able to implement a straightforward solution that efficiently connects each part of the system, allowing for easy event browsing, ticket reservations, and secure payment processing.
